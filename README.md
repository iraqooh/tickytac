# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Features

- 3x3 Game Board: The game board is represented by a 2D array (char board[3][3]).
- Player Selection: Two players (X and O) are represented using an enum (Player { X, O }).
- Turn-based Gameplay: Players alternate turns, with the current player tracked by a variable (currentPlayer).
- Win/Loss/Draw Detection: The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals.
- User Input: Players make moves by entering row and column numbers via the command line.
- Game Restart: Players have the option to restart the game, which resets the board and starts a new game.
